study	COP	NCATS-COP01		Models for Diagnosis and Treatment of Human Cancers Using Comparative Canine-Human Transcriptomics	This study was designed to 1) Apply experimental and bioinformatics methods to analyze seven canine cancer tissue types and discover gene groups (modules) relevant to cancer in canines, 2) Identify 'conserved gene modules' common to both canine and human cancers, to facilitate drug candidate testing in dogs, 3) Identify biochemical pathways and controlling transcription factors associated with the conserved modules, 4) Use the conserved modules to identify cancer biomarker and drug repurposing hypotheses suitable for experimental validation in both canines and humans.	Transcriptomics		June 2017 - June 2018
