study	COP	COTC007B	844701	Preclinical Comparison of Three Indenoisoquinoline Candidates in Tumor-Bearing Dogs	A clinical trial of 3 indenoisoquinoline candidates was conducted in tumor-bearing dogs in order to define their comparative safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic modulation profiles. The trial was divided into 2 phases: (1) study of dose escalation, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and (2) cohort expansion at the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) to confirm the PK-PD profile of each agent. Study objectives were to distinguish the toxicity profiles of these agents and determine whether there was a difference in their biological activities. The results of this trial confirmed both validity of the approach as well as the reproducibility of the correlative PD assay (gamma-H2AX), and were used to direct the conduct of the indenoisoquinoline evaluation in human patients.
